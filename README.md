# binSnippets
EXPERIMENTAL (under on-going dev) - Ruby code, VB snippets and Python using the Contacts Class Object to automate Data Entry into Ditto. Among other things


Some  Tools:

Ditto - http://ditto-cp.sourceforge.net/

SQLite - Back end DB to store what goes into the clipboard.

MS Access - ODBC connect to SQLite (Although Access is not very scalable it is a very  quick and dirty tool to proto-type front end apps). Almost any version will do.

Ruby - Inspiration from the Bastards Book of Ruby http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/
