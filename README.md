# binSnippets - Data Entry and Code Automation at the Line/Function/Class level
EXPERIMENTAL (under on-going dev) - EmacsLisp, Ruby code, VB snippets and Python using the Contacts Class Object to automate Data Entry into Ditto. Among other things

An important reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snippet_(programming)


### Some  Tools:

Yasnippet in Emacs - https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Yasnippet or refer to this awesome tutorial http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_templates.html. Once mastered improves coding efficiency within the EMACs editing ecosystem by auto code generation on a class/object/function level. 

- [.emacs](https://github.com/RayNieva/OrgWindowsDesktop/blob/master/.emacs) Configures into Emacs.

Ditto - http://ditto-cp.sourceforge.net/  A Clipboard Manager with a SQLite DB backend

[SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite) - Backend DB to store what goes into the clipboard.

MS Access - [ODBC connect to SQLite](http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/) (Although Access is not very scalable it is a very  quick and dirty tool to proto-type front end apps). Almost any version will do.
